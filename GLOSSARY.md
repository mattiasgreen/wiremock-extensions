# wiremock-extensions

Production extensions and developer tooling for WireMock Standalone, providing protocol mediation (Casual XATMI, OpenAPI), stateful simulation, L4/L7 network emulation, observability, and an embedded Web UI and CLI.

## Language

### Casual Protocol & Mediation

**Casual Domain Gateway**:
An in-process Netty TCP server that speaks the binary Casual XATMI network protocol, routing inbound service calls and domain discovery either to local WireMock stubs or over native TCP to an upstream Casual domain.
_Avoid_: Casual proxy, Casual listener, XATMI adapter

**XATMI-to-HTTP Mediation**:
The bidirectional translation between Casual XATMI messages (`ServiceBuffer`, `ErrorState`, `TransactionState`, user return codes, XA vote overrides) and synthetic WireMock HTTP probes (`/ __casual/services/<name>`, `X-Casual-*` headers, HTTP status codes, and `ServeEvent` records).
_Avoid_: HTTP mapping, buffer conversion, protocol bridge

**Protocol Version Normalization**:
Adapting Casual network frames (`SERVICE_CALL_REQUEST`, `SERVICE_CALL_REPLY`) to match the negotiated `ProtocolVersion` (`1.0`/`1.2` with inline `XID` vs. `1.3+` with `SpanId` and no reply `XID`) on a specific TCP connection.
_Avoid_: frame downgrading, version rebuilding

**2PC Transaction Coordinator**:
The module that tracks transactional `Xid` enlistment across upstream Casual domains and synthetic local XA vote overrides (`prepare`, `commit`, `rollback`), aggregating `XAReturnCode` outcomes across participants.
_Avoid_: XA bridge, transaction manager, Xid tracker
